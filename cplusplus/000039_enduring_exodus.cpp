/**
 * In an attempt to escape the Mischievous Mess Makers' antics, Farmer John has abandoned his farm and is traveling
 * to the other side of Bovinia. During the journey, he and his k cows have decided to stay at the luxurious Grand
 * Moo-dapest Hotel. The hotel consists of n rooms located in a row, some of which are occupied.
 *
 * Farmer John wants to book a set of k+1 currently unoccupied rooms for him and his cows. He wants his cows to stay
 * as safe as possible, so he wishes to minimize the maximum distance from his room to the room of his cow. The distance
 * between rooms i and j is defined as ∣j−i∣. Help Farmer John protect his cows by calculating this minimum possible distance.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1≤k<n≤100000) — the number of rooms in the hotel and the
 * number of cows travelling with Farmer John.
 *
 * The second line contains a string of length n describing the rooms. The i-th character of the string will be '0' if
 * the ith​​ room is free, and '1' if the ith​​ room is occupied. It is guaranteed that at least k+1 characters of this
 * string are '0', so there exists at least one possible choice of k+1 rooms for Farmer John and his cows to stay in.
 *
 * Output:
 * Print the minimum possible distance between Farmer John's room and his farthest cow.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 7 2
 * 0100100
 *
 * Output:
 * 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * 5 1
 * 01010
 *
 * Output:
 * 2
