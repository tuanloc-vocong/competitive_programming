 * Calendars control our daily lives. For people like me, who are bad at multitasking, it is important to have at most one task
 * planned for any minute of my life. Your job is to make sure that my calendar is free of conflicts for the next one million
 * minutes (just over 99 weeks) of my life. To keep things simple, all times are expressed in minutes from a fixed time 0
 * representing “now”.
 *
 * In this calendar, there are two types of tasks: one-time tasks and repeating tasks. One-time tasks have a start time and an
 * end time. Repeating tasks have a start time and an end time for their first occurrence, and a repetition interval. Repeating
 * tasks are assumed to keep repeating forever without end. For example, a repeating task with start time 5, end time 8 and
 * repetition interval 100 would be occurring at time intervals [5..8], [105..108], [205..208], . . .
 *
 * Tasks are considered to be in conflict if and only if their time intervals overlap, for example [2..5] and [4..6] overlap.
 * “Touching” is OK, for example [2..5] and [5..6] do not overlap.
 *
 * Input:
 * There are approximately 30 test cases. The first line of each test case contains two numbers n and m. n is the number of
 * one-time tasks and m the number of repeating tasks. The following n lines contain two numbers each, the start and end times
 * respectively of a one-time task. Afterward, m more lines similarly describe the repeating tasks by giving their start times,
 * end times, and repetition intervals. Both n and m are at most 100. All numbers are integers in the range [0..1000000]. For each
 * task, the end time is guaranteed to be larger than the start time, and the repetition interval is larger than 0. Input terminates
 * with a line containing ‘0 0’ which should not be processed
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case, print a single line containing either the words ‘NO CONFLICT’ if there are no overlaps between any tasks for
 * minutes 0..1000000, or ‘CONFLICT’ if there is at least one overlap
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 2 0
 * 10 20
 * 20 30
 * 2 0
 * 10 30
 * 20 21
 * 1 1
 * 1000 2000
 * 0 10 1000
 * 0 0
 *
 * Output:
 * NO CONFLICT
 * CONFLICT
 * CONFLICT
