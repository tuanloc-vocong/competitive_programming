 * Toad Rash has a binary string s. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.
 *
 * Let n be the length of s.
 *
 * Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers l,r that 1≤l≤r≤n and there is at least one pair of integers x,k such that
 * 1≤x,k≤n,l≤x<x+2k≤r, and sx=sx+k=sx+2k​​.
 *
 * Find this number of pairs for Rash.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line contains the string s(1≤∣s∣≤300000), consisting of zeros and ones.
 *
 * Output:
 * Output one integer: the number of such pairs of integers l,r that 1≤l≤r≤n and there is at least one pair of integers x,k such that
 * 1≤x,k≤n,l≤x<x+2k≤r, and sx=sx+k=sx+2k​​.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 11001100
 *
 * Output:
 * 0
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * 010101
 *
 * Output:
 * 3
 *
 * Explanation:
 * In the first example, there are no values x,k for the initial string, so the answer is 0.
 * In the second example, there are three l,r pairs we need to count: 1,6; 2,6; and 1,5.
